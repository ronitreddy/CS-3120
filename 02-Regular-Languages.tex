\question[3]{
Draw out \emph{DFA}s (not \emph{NFA}s) for each of the following languages. For some of these, a small hint is provided. Your goal is to construct a \emph{DFA} with as few states as possible (just like how we prefer to write succinct code when possible). For all of these, let $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\{w \ | \ w \text{ does not contain the substring } abba \}$ (\emph{*Hint: Draw out the DFA for a simpler language that DOES contain abba and then try to change that machine slightly.})
	\item $\{w \ | \ w \text{ contains BOTH the substrings ab and ba}\}$
	\item $\{w \ | \ w \in a^*b^*a^* \}$
	\item $\{w \ | \ w \neq ab \wedge w \neq bb \}$
	\item $\{w \ | \ w \in a^iw' \ | \ i \in \mathbb{N}, w' \in \{a,b\}^*, \text{w' contains at least i a's} $ (\emph{*Hint: This one LOOKS not regular but it actually is. Can you figure out why?})

\question[3]{
Prove that regular languages are closed under \emph{intersection}. Do this by starting with \emph{DFA}s for two regular languages $A$ and $B$, and describe how to construct a new \emph{DFA} for $A \cap B$\
\\

We start with two regular languages A and B, whose DFA's can be represented as $M_A = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_{A0}, F_A)$ and $M_B = (Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_B, q_{B0}, F_B)$. To construct a new DFA for $A \cap B$, say $M_C = (Q_A $ x $ Q_B, \Sigma, (\delta_A(q_A,a),\delta_A(q_A,a)) ,F_A $ x $ F_B)$, such that we would need to take the cross product and get all pairs of states and a transition function that simulates transitions for both DFAs $M_A $ and $ M_B$.\\
\\
Let w be any string in $\Sigma*$, we need to show that w $\in$ a language, $C$, accepted by $M_C$. If w exists in the set $A \cap B$, then it must reach accepting states in both A and B, such that $q_A \in F_A$ and $q_B \in F_B$ where $F_C$ will reach a state $(q_A, q_B)$. The string $w$ will be apart of the language $C$ by construction of the DFA for $C$ as it will only accept strings to be part of the language if it is in languages $A$ and $B$.

\question[3]{
Prove that regular languages are closed under \emph{complement}. Do this by starting with a \emph{DFA} for a regular language $A$, and describe how to construct a new \emph{DFA} for $\bar{A}$.
\\

Let $M = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_A)$ be a DFA for the regular language $A$, where $Q_A$ is the set of states, $\Sigma$ is the alphabet, $\delta$ is the transition function, $q_0$ is the start state, and $F_A$ is the set of accepting states.\\
\\
To construct a DFA for the complement of $A$, denoted $\bar{A}$, we define a new DFA $M' = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, Q_A \setminus F_A)$. In this new DFA, the set of accepting states is $Q_A \setminus F_A$, meaning all states in $Q_A$ that were not accepting in $A$ are now accepting in $M'$.\\
\\
For any string $w$, if $w$ is in the language $A$, it is accepted by $M$, meaning the state reached after processing $w$ is in $F_A$. However, in $M'$, this same string $w$ will be rejected, as $w$ leads to a state that is not in the accepting set of $M'$. Conversely, if $w$ is not in $A$, it will be accepted by $M'$. This construction proves that the complement of a regular language is also regular.

\question[3]{
For any string $w = w_1w_2,...,w_n$, let $w^R$ be the reverse of string $w$ (i.e., $w^R=w_n,...,w_2,w_1$). Prove that if a language $A$ is regular, then the language $A^R = \{w^R \ | \ w \in A\}$ is also regular.

\question[3]{
Use the pumping lemma to show that the following languages are not regular OR argue that they are regular. 
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $A= \{ 0^*0^n1^n1^* \ | \ n \geq 0\}$
	\item $B= \{ www \ | \ w \in \{0,1\}^* \}$
\end{itemize}

\question[3]{
Find and describe the error that exists in the following proof. The proof attempts to show that $0^*1^*$ is not regular, when in fact it is:
\\
\\
\emph{
Assume, for sake of contradiction, that $0^*1^*$ is regular. We select an element from this language that is greater than the pumping length $p$. We select $0^p1^p$. In class, when proving that $0^n1^n$ was not regular, we showed that $0^p1^p$ cannot be pumped. Therefore, $0^*1^*$ is not regular.
}
\\
\\
The error in the proof lies in the improper selection of the string $0^p1^p$ and the misapplication of the pumping lemma in an attempt to show that $0^*1^*$ is not regular. For context, the pumping lemma for regular languages states that for any regular language $A$, there exists a pumping length $p$ such that any string $s \in A$ where $|s| \geq p$ can be divided into three parts $s = xyz$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for each $i \geq 0, xy^iz \in A$,
    \item $|y| > 0$,
    \item $|xy| \leq p$.
\end{itemize}

In this case, the proof incorrectly references this concept to select the string $0^p1^p$ from the language $0^*1^*$ and assumes that this string cannot be pumped, following the reasoning outlined in class to prove that $0^n1^n$ is not regular. However, $0^*1^*$ is a different language with a simpler structure than $0^n1^n$, allowing any number of $0$'s followed by any number of $1$'s as opposed to requiring the number of $0$'s to exactly match the number of $1$'s; accordingly, the string $0^p1^p$ can indeed be pumped within this language.\\
\\
For example, if we select $y$ to be a portion of the $0$'s (e.g., $y = 0^k$ for some $k > 0$), we can pump $y$ by repeating or omitting occurrences of $0$'s (i.e., consider strings $0^{p+k}1^p$ or $0^{p-k}1^p$), and the resulting strings will still belong to $0^*1^*$. Similarly, if $y$ consists of $1$'s, the same process applies, and all pumped versions of the string will still fit within the structure of the language. As such, pumping $y$ in any case still produces a valid string in $0^*1^*$, as it merely changes the number of $0$'s but retains the structure of some number of $0$'s followed by some number of $1$'s, which is allowed by the language.\\
\\
Conclusively, the root issue in the proof is the incorrect assumption that $0^*1^*$ behaves like $0^n1^n$, where the number of $0$'s must match the number of $1$'s. Instead, with $0^*1^*$, there is no such restriction on the relationship between the number of $0$'s and the number of $1$'s, meaning that the pumping lemma can be applied without generating strings that fall outside the language. Thus, the proof fails in its attempt to employ rationale pertaining to a non-regular language in $0^n1^n$ to show that the language $0^*1^*$ is also not regular, when, in fact, it is regular.
